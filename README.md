# Checks-post-facto
The project involves reconstructing the checkerboard game states from recorded move sequences in a Checkers tournament. It aims to visualize the movement of black and white pieces based on the input provided, demonstrating the flow of moves and showing the final board configuration after all moves are executed. This involves interpreting the rules of Checkers, handling simple moves and jump moves, and accurately representing the board state throughout the game.
